===== Actually using the ingredients =====

I. THE CHICKEN
	Step 1: Preparing the marinade. Get a bowl and add these ingredients:
	- Mix:
		- 4 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt
		- 2 tablespoons olive oil
		- 1.5 lemons-worth of juice
		- 3/4 head of garlic, crushed
		- 2 teaspoons cumin
		- 2 teaspoons paprika
		- 1.25 teaspoons Schwartz Mixed Spice (Ground Cinnamon (Cassia )(40%), Ground Coriander (38%), Caraway, Nutmeg (4%), Ginger, Cloves)
		- 3/4 teaspoon turmeric
		- 1 pinch garlic powder
		- 1 pinch chili powder
		- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
		- salt and pepper, as much as you would normally put on the chicken at hand

	Step 2: Preparing the chicken
	- Cut breasts and thighs into 1-inch thick pieces
	- Put cut pieces of chicken into a bowl
	- Thoroughly mix marinade with the chicken
	- Let chicken rest for at least 2 hours, to overnight

	Step 3: Baking the chicken
	- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
	- Put a sheet of foil on a baking sheet large enough to fit all the chicken without overcrowding too much
	- Put all of the chicken on the baking sheet, be careful not to put too much marinade with the chicken
	- Let cook for about however many minutes until done but not overcooked to hell

	Step 4: Finishing off the chicken
	- Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for a bit 
	- Slice the chicken into smaller shawarma-esque pieces
	- Put half of the chicken into a pan (since the pan likely won't fit all of the chicken) on medium-high with 1tbsp of olive oil, and let go for a couple minutes until the really small pieces start getting nice and crispy
	- Repeat for the other half

II. THE SALAD
	Step 1: Preparing the veggies
	- Finely chop 1/2 head of parsley
	- Roughly dice 3 salad tomatos
	- Cut 1/2 inch cross sections of baby gem lettuce, ditch the gross bottom

	Step 2: Preparing the dressing
	- Mix:
		- some olive oil
		- a little less white wine vineager
		- 1/2 lemon, squeezed
		- salt and pepper to taste

	Step 3: Duh
	- Get the salad dressed, and ready for school

III. THE SIDES
	- Hummus
	- Toum
	- Whichever pickled stuff you chose
