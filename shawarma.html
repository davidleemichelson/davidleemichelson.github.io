===== Actually using the ingredients =====</p>

<p>I. THE CHICKEN<br />
 Step 1: Preparing the marinade. Get a bowl and add these ingredients:<br />
 - Mix:<br />
 - 4 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt<br />
 - 2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
 - 1.5 lemons-worth of juice<br />
 - 3/4 head of garlic, crushed<br />
 - 2 teaspoons cumin<br />
 - 2 teaspoons paprika<br />
 - 1.25 teaspoons Schwartz Mixed Spice (Ground Cinnamon (Cassia )(40%), Ground Coriander (38%), Caraway, Nutmeg (4%), Ginger, Cloves)<br />
 - 3/4 teaspoon turmeric<br />
 - 1 pinch garlic powder<br />
 - 1 pinch chili powder<br />
 - 1/2 teaspoon oregano<br />
 - salt and pepper, as much as you would normally put on the chicken at hand</p>

<p> Step 2: Preparing the chicken<br />
 - Cut breasts and thighs into 1-inch thick pieces<br />
 - Put cut pieces of chicken into a bowl<br />
 - Thoroughly mix marinade with the chicken<br />
 - Let chicken rest for at least 2 hours, to overnight</p>

<p> Step 3: Baking the chicken<br />
 - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F<br />
 - Put a sheet of foil on a baking sheet large enough to fit all the chicken without overcrowding too much<br />
 - Put all of the chicken on the baking sheet, be careful not to put too much marinade with the chicken<br />
 - Let cook for about however many minutes until done but not overcooked to hell</p>

<p> Step 4: Finishing off the chicken<br />
 - Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for a bit <br />
 - Slice the chicken into smaller shawarma-esque pieces<br />
 - Put half of the chicken into a pan (since the pan likely won't fit all of the chicken) on medium-high with 1tbsp of olive oil, and let go for a couple minutes until the really small pieces start getting nice and crispy<br />
 - Repeat for the other half</p>

<p>II. THE SALAD<br />
 Step 1: Preparing the veggies<br />
 - Finely chop 1/2 head of parsley<br />
 - Roughly dice 3 salad tomatos<br />
 - Cut 1/2 inch cross sections of baby gem lettuce, ditch the gross bottom</p>

<p> Step 2: Preparing the dressing<br />
 - Mix:<br />
 - some olive oil<br />
 - a little less white wine vineager<br />
 - 1/2 lemon, squeezed<br />
 - salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p> Step 3: Duh<br />
 - Get the salad dressed, and ready for school</p>

<p>III. THE SIDES<br />
 - Hummus<br />
 - Toum<br />
 - Whichever pickled stuff you chose</p>
